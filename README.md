Submitted by: Oscar Reyes

Time spent: 7.5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

I kept getting the message 'terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException'.
There was a problem with the outlets on my view controller, which led me to redo the
entire project three times, which is why I am submitting so late.
